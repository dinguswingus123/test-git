<h1 style="background-color:black; color:white;">Robert Frost: Nothing Gold Can Stay</h1>

<p style="background-color:#FFD700;">
Nature’s first green is gold.<br>
Her hardest hue to hold.<br>
Her early leaf’s a flower;<br>
But only so an hour.<br>
Then leaf subsides to leaf.<br>
So Eden sank to grief,<br>
So dawn goes down to day.<br>
Nothing gold can stay.

<h1 style="background-color: black; color:white;"> Oscar Wilde: Symphony in Yellow</h1>

<p style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
An omnibus across the bridge<br>
Crawls like a yellow butterfly,<br>
And, here and there, a passer-by<br>
Shows like a little restless midge.
  </p>
<p style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
Big barges full of yellow hay<br>
Are moored against the shadowy wharf,<br>
And, like a yellow silken scarf,<br>
The thick fog hangs along the quay.
  </p>
<p style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
The yellow leaves begin to fade<br>
And flutter from the Temple elms,<br>
And at my feet the pale green Thames<br>
Lies like a rod of rippled jade.
  </p>
